This project uses decision trees to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for thalassaemia prevention in Thailand. Four main strategies are evaluated against "no screening": post-conception screening, pre-conception screening (Option 1: using CBC & Hb typing with targeted DNA analysis), pre-conception screening (Option 2: using universal DNA analysis) and a combination of pre- and post-conception screening. The primary outcome of interest is the incremental cost of screening per severe thalassaemia birth averted compared to "no screening" (ICER). These ICERs are then compared to the lifetime cost of managing a patient with severe thalassaemia in Thailand to determine whether these strategies are cost-effective or not. Univariate deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, as well as scenario analyses, are conducted to handle parameter and structural uncertainties in the models.
